# AGS Game Project
This is the Game project for the AGS NZOI group.

## Requirements

This project uses:
* glew
* glfw
* glm
* opengl
* (later) Box2D

These will be needed to develop this project, they can be found using Google.
If you need help for the dependencies just ask.

## Contributing

The main branch should be kept in a working state. This means that all commits should be made to a separate branch
and committed later. The branch should only be merged when at least the header files and basic functionality is done.
You can add to **your** header files after to add new functionality but try not to remove or change methods without consulting
people who may be using them.

If you want a feature create an issue, someone whose job is most close to the requested feature or whose code it involved.
