# AGS Game Project
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AGS-Programming-Club/AGS-Game-Project.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AGS-Programming-Club/AGS-Game-Project)  
This is the Game project for the AGS NZOI group.

## Requirements

This project uses:
* glew
* glfw
* glm
* opengl
* (later) Box2D

These will be needed to develop this project, they can be found using Google.
If you need help for the dependencies just ask.

## Box2D
Read the manual: http://box2d.org/manual.pdf

## Contributing

The main branch should be kept in a working state. This means that all commits should be made to a separate branch
and committed later. The branch should only be merged when at least the header files and basic functionality is done.
You can add to **your** header files after to add new functionality but try not to remove or change methods without consulting people who may be using them.

If you want a feature create an issue, someone whose job is most close to the requested feature or whose code it involved will assign themselves or get assigned to it by the project manager.

Large additions that affect the whole project should be added using a pull request so others can have a look, otherwise simply merge using the command line or whatever other tool floats your boat, for more info click [here](http://gitref.org/branching/).
